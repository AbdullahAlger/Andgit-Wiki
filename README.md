#Andgit 
###__("Knowledge" in Old English)__

This project is a wiki creator built with Ruby on Rails and the pages have been written using HAML. Testing of the application is done through RSpec and Capybara. Some of the gems that have been used in the project are the following: 

* Devise
* Pundit
* Stripe
* Bourbon
* HAML 
* RSpec
* Capybara
* FactoryGirl

###Frontend

All of the frontend CSS has been written using Sass, and Bower has been included to support the downloading of libraries, in order to avoid cluttering the Gem file. If you wanted to include Angular or other frameworks, it's possible to use Bower to install all your necessary libraries for the frontend of your own project. Use `bower init` and then proceed to use the command `bower install <whatever> --save-dev`. All of the downloaded files are located in the `vendor/components/` folder which should be generated once you do a `bower init` and `bower install <whatever>`.
 
###Users 

To create a user, just click "register", which will bring you to the registration page. This has been generated by Devise. The styling here is rough and will be updated in future releases. However, the intent here is just to get you registered in order to play with the site. Once you have registered, you will be sent an email notifying you that your account has been created in order for you to sign in. All users are by default standard users, so you will not have access to create private wikis and add collaborators to your project. If you would like to do this, you can click the button "
